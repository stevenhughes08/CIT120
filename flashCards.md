## Chapter 4 Flashcards

1. **Cascading if statement**: A series of nested if statements
2. **if-then clause**: The part of a decision that holds the resulting action when the Boolean expression in a selection struture is true.
3. **NOT operator !=**: A symbol that reverses the meaning of a Boolean expression.
4. **Conditional OR operator (or, more simply, an OR operator)**: A symbol used to combine decisions when any one condition can be true or an action to occur. Also called an **OR operator**.
5. **OR decision**: A decision that contains two or more conditions; if at least one condition is met, then the resulting action takes place.
6. **relational comparison operators**: A symbol that expresses Boolean comparisions.
7. **Case Structure**: A structure that tests a single variable against multiple values, providing separate actions for each logical path.
8. **Trivial expression**: An expression that always evaluets to the same value.
9. **else clause**: A part of a selction structre that holds the action or actions that execute only when the tested Boolean expression is false.
10. **short-circuit evaluation**: A logical feature in wheich each part of a larger expression is evaluated only as far as necessary to determine the final outcome.
11. **Dead or unreachable path**: A logical path that can never be traveled; also called unreachable.
12. **Conditional AND operator (or more simply, an AND operator)**: A symbol used to combine decisions so that two or more conditions must be true for an action to occur. Also called an AND operator.
13. **Compound Conditon**: An evaluation wiht multiiple parts.
14. **if-then**: A single-alternative seleciton structure; it contains a tested Boolean expression and an action that is taken only when the expression is true.
15. **Unary operator**: An operator that uses only one operand.
16. **Range check**: The comparison of a variable to a series of values that mark the limiting ends of ranges.
17. **Conditional AND operator, or more simply, an AND operator**: A symbol used to combine decisions so that two or more conditions must be true for an action to occur. Also called an AND operator.
18. **Trivial expressions**: An expression that always evaluates to the same value.
19. **And decision**: A decision in which two conditions must both be true for an action to take place.
20. **Nested decision, or nexted if**: A decision whithin the if-then or else clause of another decision. Also called a _Nested if_
21. **Truth Tables**: A diagram used in mathematics and logic to help describe the truth of its parts.
22. **Conditional OR operator**: A symbol used to combine decisions when any one condition can be true or an action ot occur. Also called an _OR operator_.
